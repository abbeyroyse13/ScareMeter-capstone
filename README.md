# ScareMeter! | My Frontend Capstone

## ScareMeter- what is it? 
--- 
### 
ScareMeter is geared towards horror enthusiasts or anyone who just wants a good scare. 
Once the user creates an account, they are presented with several options to choose from out of
horror related movies, shows, games, and books. When they've found something that interests them,
they'll be able to save said content to a list on their account. Everything they save will be 
located there and they can access it at any time. When the user clicks on an item in their list, 
it takes them to a menu where they're presented with options to remove it, like (or dislike) it,
and rate it (with the ScareMeter!). There is also the ability to comment and connect with others
about a certain piece of horror media.
